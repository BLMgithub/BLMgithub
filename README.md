## Analytical Focus

I work on **analytics that support real decisions**, not just insight generation. <br>
My focus is on validating whether data signals are **safe to act on** before time, budget, or operational capacity is committed.

## What I Do

I work across **problem framing**, **exploratory analysis**, **prioritization**, and **decision review**.

Most of my work focuses on:

- Validating whether signals are **safe to act on**
- Making assumptions and constraints explicit
- Narrowing options over time, not expanding them

I care more about **clarity than complexity**, and about knowing what not to do.

## What You'll Find Here

- Decision oriented analyses
- Exploratory work used to surface structure early
- Reusable analysis scaffolding designed to be challenged and reused
- Artifacts that make assumptions, constraints, and trade offs explicit
